## Development

This template is based on the accessible [love2d-a11y-template](https://github.com/JRJurman/love2d-a11y-template). To run this project, you'll need to install the npm dependencies and run the included build script.

```sh
npm ci
npm run build
```

After that, you can either open `toasty.love` using the love application, or you can start a web-server (which enables screen-reader support).

```sh
npm start
```
